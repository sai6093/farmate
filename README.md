This project builds a Generative AI chatbot that explains crop lifecycle and farming processes. The bot clarifies sowing, irrigation, harvesting, and storage stages. Gemini Flash models provide simple, easy-to-understand explanations. A Streamlit web interface allows interaction. System prompts restrict the bot to informational responses only.
